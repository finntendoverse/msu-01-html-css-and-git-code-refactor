# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Description
AS A marketing agency<br>
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards<br>
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards<br>
WHEN I view the source code<br>
THEN I find semantic HTML elements<br>
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements<br>
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning<br>
WHEN I view the icon and image elements<br>
THEN I find accessible alt attributes<br>
WHEN I view the heading attributes<br>
THEN they fall in sequential order<br>
WHEN I view the title element<br>
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
